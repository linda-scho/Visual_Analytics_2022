## Desription
* **Project**:The region of Sächsische Schweiz, Germany, in English, Saxon Switzerland, is a popular climbing destination, characterized by sandstone climbing areas, where climbers can enjoy free climbing. However, the fragility of the sandstone material makes climbing very dangerous and caused special ethical and safety rules for climbing (theCrag 2023). Also, the information is rare and often only available via personal connections. Thus, a dashboard was created to increase transparency and easy access to this area. It can be used as an overview for people new to the area as well as a source of in-depth information for already experienced climbers. Also, climbing clubs (e.g., German Alpine Association (DAV)) can gain valuable insights on which they base, for example decisions on the location of courses or guided tours as well as the necessity of natural conservation projects.
  
* **Course**: The course aimed to teach students about the phenomena of visual analytics and its application of fundamental concepts, techniques and methods. Students were taught basic knowledge of data types, data structures, and how to interact with a relational database management system. The course also covered the ability to analyze and apply visual analytics techniques for big/business data sets in organizational contexts, understand the linkages between business intelligence and visual analytics and the potential benefits for organizations, apply analytical skills for implementation of business data processing using Business Intelligence and Reporting tools, exhibit basic knowledge of securing or masking sensitive data while applying visual analytics, and exhibit deeper knowledge and understanding of the topics as part of a project, with the report reflecting critical awareness of methodological choices and written to accepted academic standards.
